Connect 4 Game in JavaðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´:

This Connect 4 game represents my first substantial Java project after learning the language basics. It demonstrates:
1. Object-oriented programming principles
2. 2D array manipulation for game board logic
3. Game loop implementation
4. User input handling
5. Win condition checking algorithms (veertical, diagonal, horizontal)
Built entirely from scratch to solidify my understanding of Java syntax and programming concepts.

ðŸŽ® Game Features:
1. Complete GUI buillt with Java Swing
2.Traditional 6x7 Connect 4 grid
3. Two-player (Red vs Yellow) local gameplay
4. Win detection (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
5. Basic error handling for invalid moves
6. Simple console-based interface

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:
1. Applied OOP principles in a real project
2. Mastered Swing components and event handling
3. Developed game-specific algorithms
4. Gained experience in debugging complex logic
5. Learned GUI best practices
